      Life is full of twists and turns, we can't prevent them all, but we can protect ourselves from the damages of uncertain events.
       Now more than ever it is prevalent that we don't have control over what happens to us, even the healthiest of people, the
       media has made that clear.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Life insurance policies will make sure your future is protected and the ones you love are covered, even if you are no longer
       there to protect them. Life insurance is an important part of financial and retirement planning. In addition to protection, you
        can supplement your retirement with funds from your life insurance policy for a comfortable future. And during this pandemic
       Many are wishing for a comfortable future. 
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>


      Most of us are past preventative care with little people sticking to the government guidelines, so when the worst does happen,      
      due to others not taking the pandemic seriously, we need to make sure that we are protected, from both this pandemic and our
       unpredictable future.  
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      I have asked myself in the past ‘what is life insurance for?’ and the answer has never been clearer, especially during these
       trying times. I have taken a policy to cover my loved ones and my close friends, if I was to be tested positive for life threatening
        illness I would be more at ease knowing my family and friends will get a little something more if the worst was to happen to me.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      No matter your age you can be inflicted by illness or a random unfortunate event at any time. There are a variety of flexible
       options available to meet your needs now and for the future. I consulted with a financial professional at ‘here 4 life’ to learn
        more about various types of policies and the one that was best for me.

         I recommend getting a quote today to ease your own anxiety and stress. It did me a world of good. All it takes is less than five
          minutes and you could be covered for the rest of your life.
