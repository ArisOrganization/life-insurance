      <br>
      Life is full of twists and turns, we can't prevent them all, but we can protect ourselves from the damages of uncertain events.
      <br>
       Now more than ever it is prevalent that we don't have control over what happens to us, even the healthiest of people, the
      <br>
       media has made that clear.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Life insurance policies will make sure your future is protected and the ones you love are covered, even if you are no longer
      <br>
       there to protect them. Life insurance is an important part of financial and retirement planning. In addition to protection, you
      <br> can supplement your retirement with funds from your life insurance policy for a comfortable future. And during this pandemic
      <br>
       Many are wishing for a comfortable future. 
       <br>
       <br>


      Most of us are past preventative care with little people sticking to the government guidelines, so when the worst does happen,
      <br>
      due to others not taking the pandemic seriously, we need to make sure that we are protected, from both this pandemic and our
      <br> unpredictable future.  
      <br>
      <br>
      I have asked myself in the past ‘what is life insurance for?’ and the answer has never been clearer, especially during these
      <br>
       trying times. I have taken a policy to cover my loved ones and my close friends, if I was to be tested positive for life threatening
       <br>
        illness I would be more at ease knowing my family and friends will get a little something more if the worst was to happen to me.
        <br>
        <br>
      No matter your age you can be inflicted by illness or a random unfortunate event at any time. There are a variety of flexible
      <br>
       options available to meet your needs now and for the future. I consulted with a financial professional at ‘here 4 life’ to learn
       <br>
        more about various types of policies and the one that was best for me.
        <br>
        <br>
         I recommend getting a quote today to ease your own anxiety and stress. It did me a world of good. All it takes is less than five
         <br>
          minutes and you could be covered for the rest of your life.
